# CVE-2016-7434 ntpd DOS exploit
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/vulnerables/cve-2016-7434.svg?style=plastic)](https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/cve-2016-7434/)

Ntpd suffer from a null pointer reference which is possible to trigger to crash the application. According to NTP.org, "If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist query packet."

The ntpd program is an operating-system daemon that sets and maintains a computer system's system time in synchronization with Internet-standard time servers. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but retains compatibility with versions 1, 2, and 3. 

The routine that reads the MRU list (```read_mru_list```) can be found [here](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2016-7434/blob/d0a66022701b38a76991ccf1816ce4ebfdb701ec/ntp-4.2.8p8/ntpd/ntp_control.c#L3952)

# Exploit

If you want a vulnerable system to test this exploit, you can use docker to create it

    docker run --rm -it --name ntpvulnerable -p 123:123/udp vulnerables/cve-2016-7434 

It will start a docker container with a vulnerable ntpd, so you will be able to exploit it.

## python

    ./exploit.py -t <target ip> -p <target port>

## bash

    ./exploit.sh <target ip> <target port>

## Bug

If you choose to run your exploit against your docker container, it will show the result bellow:
