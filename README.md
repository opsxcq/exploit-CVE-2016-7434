# CVE-2016-7434 ntpd DOS exploit

The ntpd program is an operating-system daemon that sets and maintains a computer system's system time in synchronization with Internet-standard time servers. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but retains compatibility with versions 1, 2, and 3. Ntpd suffer from a null pointer reference which is possible to trigger to crash the application.


This reference is in:

    _IO_str_init_static_internal()

# Vulnerable versions

 * ntp-4.2.7p22, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9
