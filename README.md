# CVE-2016-7434 ntpd DOS exploit

Ntpd suffer from a null pointer reference which is possible to trigger to crash the application. According to NTP.org, "If ntpd is configured to allow mrulist query requests from a server that sends a crafted malicious packet, ntpd will crash on receipt of that crafted malicious mrulist query packet."

The ntpd program is an operating-system daemon that sets and maintains a computer system's system time in synchronization with Internet-standard time servers. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but retains compatibility with versions 1, 2, and 3.
